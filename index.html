            <p>The Foo Fighters formed in 1994. Dave Grohl was the drummer for Nirvana but when Kurt Cobain died, Grohl
                started a one man project called Foo Fighters. The Foo Fighter's have won 15 Grammy Awards and were given the Best Rock Album award 5 times.

            <h4>What They are Doing Now</h4>
            <p>Grohl faced another death of a band member when Taylor Hawkins died in March 2022. Since Hawkin's death, FF are
                without a drummer and have been in mourning, cancelling any showings for the future. This September on the 3rd and the 27th, they are doing Taylor Hawkins Tribute concerts for the late drummer. No one is sure how FF will continue their career with the loss of Hawkins.
